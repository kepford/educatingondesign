	<h3>Samantha Warren</h3>
	
	
	<p>Samantha's goal is a site that's bold, exciting, usable, and well-built. Sometimes that means she's obsessing over the perfect typeface to tell the story, while other times she'll be crunching on the markup and styles behind the scenes. A Senior Web Designer at Phase2 Technology in the Washington, DC area, recent years have found her working for a variety of clients including National Geographic, Choice Hotels International, and The National Basketball Players Association. Her passion for design and the web doesn't end at quitting time. She has been published in .NET Magazine, regularly speaks at industry events including SXSW Interactive, and is on the Board of the Art Directors Club of Washington DC. When she is not doing any of the above you can find her enthusiastically teaching typography and web design at the Center for Digital Imaging Arts at Boston University.</p>

	<h3>Layne Lev</h3>
	
	
	<p>Layne has spent the last fifteen years of his life applying his passion for graphic arts to the fields of print and web design. After spending seven years as a graphic designer in San Francisco and Silicon Valley, he returned to his native Fresno to help found Hundred10, a nationally-recognized web and mobile application development firm. The team at Hundred10 were recently awarded both "Best of Show" and "Best of the Web" at the 2010 FAF ADDY Awards. Layne holds a Bachelor of Science in Graphic Communication from Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo and is a former winner of the Fresno Design Alliance's Iron Designer Challenge. In addition to being an avid skier and racquetball player, he can (and usually will) quote any line from any movie ever filmed on cue.
